# Time-Varying Topological Descriptors for Cardiac Disease Diagnosis

## By Jon Ferreras

### Abstract

Cardiac diseases are among the most common illnesses in the world, and data scientists have created a wide range of tools to contribute to their detection and diagnosis. Topological Data Analysis in particular has been used to work for medical imaging and specifically for cardiac MRIs.

This project introduces the use of time-varying topological descriptors along a cardiac cycle and applies them for disease diagnosis. The methods used aim to develop the relationship between TDA and temporal data. We also want to contribute to the simplification, interpretability and improvement of the general approach to cardiac disease diagnosis, which usually involves costly calculations of radiomics or potential black boxes.
